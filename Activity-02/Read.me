#In this assignment, I worked on analyzing SSH log data using a Python script. I completed the tasks by implementing functions to parse failed login attempts and successful login credentials from the log file. One important change I made was correcting the filename used to run the script, as the provided log file was named cowrite-tiny.log instead of cowrie-tiny.log. This fix resolved the file-not-found errors I encountered initially. Additionally, I completed the logic in the analyze_failed_logins and analyze_successful_creds functions to accurately count and display IP addresses with failed login attempts, as well as the username/password pairs that successfully accessed the system. Overall, I tested the script with various command-line arguments to ensure correct parsing and output formatting.
